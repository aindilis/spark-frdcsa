Technical Documentation Overview

This documentation is separated into three sections. The Getting Started
documentation provides instructions for installing, configuring, and running
SPARK. The For Developers section provides advanced documentation for writing
your own SPARK-L. The Papers section links to research papers on SPARK.

Terminology

SPARK refers to the 'SRI Procedural Agent Realization Kit' agent framework. For
more about this framework, please refer to the SPARK Detailed Technical Manual.

SPARK-L is the language that the SPARK interpreter processes. SPARK-L files are
usually denoted by a .spark extension.

SPARK is distributed under a BSD-style open source license.

Getting Started

  • Requirements
  • Installation
  • Running SPARK
  • SPARK command line tutorial

For Developers

  • SPARK in a Nutshell Developer's Guide (start here). Quick reference for the
    SPARK-L language.
  • SPARK Detailed Technical Manual
  • SPARK module API documentation (SPARKDOC). This documentation is
    automatically generated from SPARK-L code and contains a listing of modules
    and their associated actions, predicates, and functions.
  • Notes on the Changes from Previous Versions of SPARK

SPARK Plugin for Eclipse:

  • Plugin User Guide
  • Plugin Installation Guide

SPARK modules/extensions:

  • iCalendar utilties for SPARK-L

Useful stuff:

  • SPARK-mode for Emacs
  • Python-mode for Emacs

Historical, do not use:
